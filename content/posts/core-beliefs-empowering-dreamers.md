# Core Beliefs – Empowering Dreamers

When we are young, we are taught to have unfettered optimism.
To believe we could discover Atlantis buried beneath the sea.
To believe we could build hoverboards like in Back to the Future II.
To believe we could cure all forms of cancer.

But as we age, those beliefs begin to fade.
Intellectual limitations show up in imperfect test scores.
Physical limitations cap athletic performance.
Economic limitations influence opportunity.

Institutions are built to produce leaders and individual contributors.
Few know how to cultivate dreamers.

Dreamers shape the world.
They live in the future.
They mold reality to their will.
They teach us that the only true failure is never to try.

We are all born dreamers.
Dreamers emerge from every place, every path, every community.
To dream is to be human.

Yet with age, society stamps out dreams and creates realists.
Those who are satisfied with the present.
Those who find happiness in complacency.
Those who never reach beyond their means.

Realists are controllable. Dreamers are unpredictable.
Realists protect the status quo. Dreamers break it.

History is written by those who are irrational, those who aspire beyond the status quo.

Instead of suppressing dreamers, we should enable them.

It's time to bring power back to the dreamers.
