# Core Beliefs – Building Reputation

Reputation is as old as time.
The rivalry of Jacob and Esau was rooted in a manipulation of reputation.
English monarchs bestowed titles, land, and knighthood to distribute reputation.
Social media has become a tool to artificially build or tear down reputation.

When we are born, we often take on the reputation of our family line.
If those before us lived with honor and respect, childhood missteps are often forgiven.
If they lived without it, early sins are seen as proof of one’s “true nature.”

Yet as one ages and builds their own life, they can pave a new path and develop an individualized reputation.

Reputations are often accelerated by attaching to platforms with established credibility.
Educational institutions, corporations, social clubs, and communities.
Your past actions dictate your future perception.

As one grows, others may ask to borrow your reputation.
A positive reputation can open doors, accelerate access to capital, establish trust, and help you cultivate further reputation.
A negative reputation has the exact inverse effect.

As we live in an era of misinformation, increased interconnectivity, and a flood of AI-driven obfuscation, reputation has become more heavily weighted.

Reputation is uniquely personal.
No two reputations are the same, even if they lead to similar outcomes.

Reputation is the rarest form of currency. Singular. Inescapable.

We should all be aware of our reputation.
