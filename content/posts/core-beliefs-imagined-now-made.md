# Core Beliefs – Imagined, Now Made

Design and manufacturing used to be one and the same.
A blacksmith shaped a sword with every swing of the hammer.
A seamstress crafted a dress with each pull of the thread.
A baker sculpted a cake with every sweep of the spatula.
Creation was embodied.
The act of making was the act of designing.

But that unity has diverged.

Today, design often lives in the abstract.
Engineers build in CAD, then ship the blueprint to a distant factory.
Fashion houses sketch garments, then send specs to factories half a world away.
Cakes are no longer crafted.
They're scaled, branded, distributed.

Globalization made manufacturing cheaper.
Software made design easier to abstract.

As companies scaled, economic incentives pushed them to separate ideation from execution.

The result?
We traded closeness for convenience, craft for speed.

The modern world split the act of imagining from the act of making.

As an observer, it's hard to tell what's been designed and what's merely been manufactured.

Modern marketing blurs the line.
"Hand-crafted."
"Family recipe."
"One of a kind."

These phrases once signaled authorship.
Now, they often mask mass production.

For the last few hundred years, design has become a journey of its own.
Entire companies have been built around a designer's worldview.
Not just in fashion or food, but in electronics, robotics, and beyond.

An engineer designs a PCB, but another team assembles it.
A scientist prototypes a fusion reactor, but the parts don't yet exist to contain it.
A founder sketches a humanoid, but no factory exists to build it.

Engineering has slanted toward design, not production.

But we're beginning to see a shift back to tradition.

We can no longer rely on technological supremacy.
We need flexibility and independent manufacturing.

Vertical integration is coming back, not just for efficiency, but for control.

More and more, designers are realizing the factories they need don't exist.

So they're reverting.

Designers are becoming builders again.

It's not just the time to create.

It's time to produce.
