# The End of the Beginning: Thoughts on moving back home

After six years away—first for college, then for work—I'm moving back to my hometown. It's a decision that feels both inevitable and surprising, marking what feels like the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.

## The Journey Away

Leaving home at 18 felt like the natural next step:
- **College**: New city, new people, new experiences
- **First job**: San Francisco, the center of the tech world
- **Career growth**: Opportunities that didn't exist back home
- **Independence**: Building a life completely separate from my roots

## What I Learned Away

Living away taught me:
- **Self-reliance**: How to build a life from scratch
- **Networking**: Creating relationships in new places
- **Adaptability**: Thriving in different environments
- **Perspective**: Seeing my hometown from the outside

## The Pull Back

Several factors drew me home:
- **Family**: Parents getting older, wanting to be closer
- **Cost of living**: San Francisco's housing market
- **Remote work**: The pandemic proved location independence
- **Community**: Missing the deeper connections of home

## The Challenges

Returning home isn't without its challenges:
- **Career opportunities**: Fewer tech jobs locally
- **Social dynamics**: Relationships have changed
- **Identity**: Who am I now in this familiar place?
- **Expectations**: Family and friends have their own ideas

## The Opportunities

But there are also unique opportunities:
- **Local impact**: Contributing to my community's growth
- **Cost advantage**: Lower living costs enable different choices
- **Network effects**: Leveraging existing relationships
- **Work-life balance**: More time for family and personal projects

## What This Means

Moving home feels like the end of the beginning—the end of the phase where I was primarily focused on exploration and growth, and the beginning of a phase focused on building and contributing.

It's not about giving up on ambition or settling for less. It's about choosing a different kind of life, one that balances career success with personal fulfillment and community connection.

## The Next Chapter

I'm excited to see what this next chapter brings. Sometimes the most radical thing you can do is go back to where you started, but as a different person.
